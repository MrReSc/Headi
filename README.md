Headi (Headache Diary) is a privacy-friendly app to log your headaches.  
No data is transferred to any cloud services. All data is stored locally only.  
Headi also offers a simple analysis of the recorded data. You can also export your logs as a CSV file for further analysis of the data.

I do not have any commercial interests. The app was created for private use and is intended to be available to everyone.

## Contribute
Headi is an open source project. Your contributions are welcome. Below you will find some ways to help me:
- Headi still needs translations. You can help to translate Headi into your language. All you have to do is create an account at [Crowdin](https://crwd.in/headi) and translate the texts.
- Further analysis of the data in the app would be useful. If you have ideas, please share them. If you can code, you can implement them.
- There is still some potential to improve the design :smirk:
- If you are good at drawing, more beautiful pictures for the regions on the head would be very welcome.
- An export function of the diary into a PDF that can be used for a visit to the doctor would also be a good function.
- No unit tests have been implemented yet either. If you like programming tests, I would be happy to receive them.
- With GitHub Actions you could implement CI/CD. That would also be great.
